<h2>A funny story</h2>
<hr>
<p>A friends' dad once invited me over for lunch to try one of his famous homemade Thai style papaya salads (som tam pet
    pet). Little did I know that he had laced it with super spicy & hot chilli peppers.
    I instantly turned red as a tomato and started to sweat all over, tears were streaming down my face and my mouth was
    on fire for at least 15 mins.
    Never trust your friends' dad's cooking.</p>

<h4>TL;DR...</h4>
<p>Don't eat Thai papaya salad if you can't handle spicy food!</p>
